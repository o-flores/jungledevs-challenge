## How to create production builds using [GitHub Pages](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages)

1. Install [gh-pages](https://github.com/tschaub/gh-pages) in your application:
```javascript
  npm install --save gh-pages
```

2. Add homepage and scripts on package.json:
```javascript
  "homepage": "https://myusername.github.io/my-app",
  "scripts": {
  "predeploy": "npm run build",
  "deploy": "gh-pages -d build"
},
```

3. Execute your app deploy:
```javascript
  npm run deploy
```

4. Finally, go to your remote repository settings and be sure to enable **gh-pages** branch:

5. That's it! Your app is now accessible at the homepage you specified in step 2. 


## How to integrate MixPanel with your application

1. MixPanel React library is already installed, so you can skip ahead and create a [MixPanel](https://mixpanel.com/) account.

2. Create a new project in MixPanel.

3. Go to your project's settings and take note of your Project Token.

4. Create a ```.env.local``` file in the root of your project and create ```REACT_APP_MIXPANEL_KEY``` [enviroment variable](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-custom-environment-variables/#adding-development-environment-variables-in-env) :

```javascript
  REACT_APP_MIXPANEL_KEY="YOUR_PROJECT_TOKEN"
```

5. That's it! Now you can track your A/B test metrics in MixPanel's Reports section:

### Accessibility

To improve Accessibility in our App we would have to increase contrast in three elements. On the span element we could achieve bigger contrast by increasing opacity to 0.8. On the buttons we would have to change the font or the button background to a darker color. So i woud take this opportunities to improve the legibility of the app to the design team.
